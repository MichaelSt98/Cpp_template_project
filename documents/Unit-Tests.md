# Unit-Tests

## Integrated in CLion



### Google Test

See Googletest - google Testing and Mocking Framework [Google test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
on Github.

### Catch

See [Catch Org](https://github.com/catchorg) and [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
for a modern, C++ native, header only test framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD.

### Boost.Test

See the [Boost.test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html)
for the C++ Boost.Test library, providing both an easy to use and flexible set of interfaces 
for writing test programs, organizing tests into simple test cases and test suites, 
and controlling their runtime execution. 

### Doctest

[Doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) is a new C++ testing framework but is by 
far the fastest both in compile times (by orders of magnitude) and runtime 
compared to other feature-rich alternatives. It brings the ability of compiled 
languages such as D / Rust / Nim to have tests written directly in the 
production code thanks to a fast, transparent and flexible test runner 
with a clean interface.
